# McGill Pathfinder - WIP 
#### Authors: Nicholas Foisy, Musab Umair (B.Sc CS & SWE @ McGill)
#### This project seeks to map all the indoor paths of McGill. A webapp will be developed where users can pick two spots on campus, indoors or outdoors, and find the shortest path between them.
#### These points could be a  point of interests (e.g. classrooms) or just any lat/long coordinate on campus.

#### As a proof of concept, all of the outdoor paths, and several floors of Burnside will be mapped and supported. The rest of the campus will be supported at a later date.
