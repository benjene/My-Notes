========================


Define APIs for sending message,
reading message


for the users table, should it have these columns
num_id,email,password,firstname,lastname,displayname

do we care for a username? do we just have them login using email?

and do we want to have data like 'city/location', so on their profile it could show that?


For user accounts, what information do we want to keep track of?
First name, last name, username, display name, email, password, maybe city/location?
