Hello,  
  
TO BE SENT VIA TEXT:  
  
---------  
Hello, I hope you two are doing OK. have things  to say. It is very long - maybe the longest yet. I will send it via email to [michel@michelfoisy.com](mailto:michel@michelfoisy.com). It is up to you if you wish to read it, but I don't see us talking before you read it and acknowledge it.  
----------  
  
WHAT IS BELOW WILL BE SENT VIA EMAIL  
  
Before I start, I just want to say I love you guys, and my criticisms do not mean I do not recognise all of the good you guys have done for me too. You guys have given me many qualities and strengths that make me a better person. But there is also room to challenge you guys, and you need to understand these are not conflicting ideas.  
  
I heard from Alex that mom was asking about how she wishes I would be willing to re-establish an "emotional connection" as opposed to focusing on financial matters. I am puzzled to hear this, because I was told, in no uncertain terms, that challenging mom on her parenting was out of the question. What emotional connection does she want? For me to come and say "I'm sorry, I was wrong about everything, I have absolutely no reason to think that there were mistakes done during my upbringing." I don't know if she will read this, so I will speak in the third person.  
  
If mom wants to "reconnect emotionally", then she should face her emotions and read what I have written. Here's something to start off with, which I thought was a settled issue, but apparently wasn't, at least several months ago.  
  
When I was in elementary school, starting in second or third grade, you guys decided it was up to me to make sure I had school lunches for the 3 times a week you didn't get me a meal from the school. At 9 years old, I wasn't responsible enough to do this, and the result was that I went to school many times without food. Most other kids had parents who packed for their kids lunches, but you guys thought it was acceptable to let your 9 year old child pack their lunch and not check more than once or twice if they actually did.  
  
I know you guys understand how unacceptable this was, because when I brought this up, dad, you conveniently forgot that this was happening in elementary school, and said that high school me was "lacking wherewithal". I will acknowledge, dad, that you came around, and actually apologised, which I am grateful for. But although I let it slide then, so I could go camping with you, I want to know now how you could've misremembered this detail. Was I unclear when I first told you this a few years ago? Or did you purposefully ignore that fact so that you could deflect responsibility, because you know you couldn't possibly blame a 9 year old?  
  
And for mom, I want her to be able to apologise to me, and make it clear you understand it was your responsibility as a parent to make sure your prepubescent child went to school with food.  
  

I also want to talk about the comments you made about me wanting you guys to take me on luxurious trips around the world. When I commented how I would like to do some international travel with you guys, I did not understand your financial situation. If I did, I would not have suggested it. What you totally missed is that I just want to spend time with you guys. You guys haven't made much of an effort to spend any time with me in the last several years. You guys have made some plans with me - going to a restaurant, going to a comedy show, etc - but I can count on one or two hands the amount of times we've spent time as a family outside of our house in the last 5 years that wasn't organised by me. Your actions make you appear as not valuing making an effort to spend time with me. Moreover - you guys very rarely asked me how things were going, or inquired about my life. You guys, especially mom, have barely texted me since I have moved out, even before we became semi estranged these last ~9 months. 

You ignored this then and I suspect you will ignore this again now, but the entire reason I hung out with a creepy man double my age, Jason, is because I lacked any sort of parental presence in my life. Jason was the only adult who seemed to think I was interesting. Who thought I was worthy of spending time with. Who made me feel like I had any value at all. And not only did you guys entirely fail to understand why I wanted to spend time with Jason in the first place, you guys let me hang out with what was clearly a creepy old man. Mom said she met him and "vetted" him or something. At the beginning of our friendship, we were in the car together, and he told me "I can tell you're clean down there. I would love to give you a blowjob". I'm lucky nothing ended up happening to me, but that isn't the point. Is this a man your teenage son should be hanging out with? Or is allowing me to go out with creepy old men yet another way of building independence? Instead of acknowledging any of these issues, dad, you implied I was some entitled princess who just wanted some jetsetting lifestyle. No, I want parents who make an effort to spend time with me and build a family. I see all of my friends have parents who plan things and I'm so jealous. You guys told me how planning time together is so difficult, but that just doesn't cut it. I'm your child, and I should be inherently worthy of your attention, and spending time with me should be worthy of effort.  
  
The root of my resentment isn't even that these things have happened. It's in the past and I know nothing can change that. What bothers me now is that you guys have shown no interest in acknowledging this. Mom wants to pretend none of this even exists, and you dad, have generally just ignored what I say, except that one time I repeatedly pressed you on me going to school without food. It's so disrespectful.  
  
So here's something you can do to mend our frayed relationship that is entirely free, to repair the "emotional connection". You and mom need to sit down and read this, and acknowledge what I've written above. If you think what I've said is wrong, then tell me specifically what you disagree with and I'll be happy to respond.  
  
On to the non-emotional side...  
Regarding my education and my moving out, it's clear that you guys do not think me getting an education is a priority. I think that is unfortunate but I have accepted it and I do not resent you for not paying for my education, and I do not expect it. However, what I think is worthy of reproach is how callously you disregard the burden of my previous commute. Whenever I mention this, you say "we did it too" - referring to how mom took (pottery?) classes in Montreal for leisure and how you dad, commuted to work. Of course, you never mention how both of you had the chance to grow up in Montreal. Tell me, have you ever waited an hour for a taxi at 1am to get home? And then you realized it would be faster to walk the 45 minutes than to wait for one? When you hung out with friends, did you get the chance to drink and stay past 10PM? Or did you have to leave by then because there's no way to get home not-sober without a lift from your parents? Did you guys spend 20+ hours a week commuting? Why do you think my ex Mia's parents, Stella's parents, and Zio Luigi and Valerie have told me that being close to university for the sake of their children is important to them? Why have P-Y, Tristan Novak, Tristan Fleet, Arielle Warten, and the other people living in Mont-Saint-Hilaire moved to Montreal to attend university? Is it a coincidence that both of your children moved out to attend university?  
  
I don't expect you guys to have moved to Montreal so that I could attend school. Though I wish you did, so that I wouldn't have had to move out. Maybe then we'd be closer. But at the very least, you guys need to acknowledge that having double the commute time of most of the other students puts me at a disadvantage. And when a close family member invites me to stay with them so I can do better in school, AT NO EXTRA COST TO YOU, (food + electricity consumption + OPUS in MSH is MORE than $358 a month), you should recognise be grateful that a beloved relative can help me and give me a greater chance to succeed in university. You should NOT see it as an opportunity to pawn me off on someone else and pocket the rest.  
  
I know that I should have graduated university last winter. I will admit that I lack wherewithal, and I was not able to complete CEGEP and University on time. I have accepted this about myself. I find school to be hard and graduating on-time didn't pan out. I know that this is inconvenient to you, because now I expect you guys to still pay for my basic living expenses like food and power consumption.  
  
You guys say you have no money. But three years ago, you spent $7000 on two brand new iPad Pros, a brand new Mac, and an e-bike. I know these things costed you around $2000, $2500, and $2500, respectively. Paying for food for me for my last 2 years of school in between last May, and May 2025 (when I graduate) is $300 * 24 = $7200.  
  
You guys clearly disagree, but I think it is a parent's duty to sacrifice the purchasing of luxury electronics so that they can have the money to pay for their children's food. I am sorry for the harsh language, but this is some very unscrupulous behaviour.  
  

I know you guys have tried to deflect responsibility by implying I'm lazy and don't want to work. Except, I've literally worked throughout the end of high school and CEGEP. I work now - 5-10 hours a month. I'm literally speaking to professors about working with them part-time in the winter and full-time in the summer on programming tasks to aid with their research. Last summer I completed a full-time course load so that I could graduate by May 2025. And I worked part-time. So I wasn't just lying around, doing nothing. But yes, I did go on a month-long vacation. 

  

I want to work - but not to pay for my basic living expenses that you want to pawn off on me or my aunt or uncle. I want to work, and I will work, in ways where I don't have to sacrifice my schoolwork or career prospects.  

  
You guys have also told me that I wasted my inheritance from my grandmother. That I receive a scholarship from the government and I don't need the money. I think you guys feel entitled to the money I have received. Me receiving a dollar does not free you from a dollar spent on your parental obligations. If your mother, dad, wanted my inheritance to relieve you from the burden of paying for the food of your student child, she would have given it to you.  
  
And I know you guys think that I should've graduated last winter - and yes, that's true. But I think I'm still worthy of having my food paid for as I pursue university - even if it takes me a bit longer than my peers. This is something you guys will need to accept.
  
In the end, it's not actually about the money. It's true I won't be out on the streets if you don't pay for my living expenses. But it's about respect. I don't want you guys to think you can just pawn me off on someone else. It feels so disrespectful to me to see you pocket the money you save on food for me and spend it on luxury electronics. Throughout this whole process, I've just felt so disrespected and ignored and I just can't put up with it anymore. It feels like I was set up to fail - you guys move somewhere with an unreasonably long commute, and when I move out so I can attend school, tell me that I "made a lifestyle choice", and so you guys no longer have any obligation to support me. I literally moved into the basement of my aunt and uncle's place. I'm not living some lavish dorm life. It also bothers me that you guys think your parental responsibility expires at the age of 22. Would you be charging me money if I was still living at home, still attending university? Though, I do acknowledge that you still pay my transit pass and medical expenses, which I am grateful for. But I clearly think that pawning the rest off on me or my aunt and uncle is unacceptable.

What also really bothers me too is how you guys act like all of this is for my own good. That I will learn to pull myself up by my bootstraps if I take on this added responsibility. That I'm ungrateful and can't recognise all that you've done for me. Was it for my own good to go to school without food? Was it for my own good to hang out with Jason? Was it for my own good that you and mom rarely made efforts to spend time with me? Dad, when you went to university, who succeeded the most? Was it the ones who had to work part-time to pay for school and food? Or was it the people who had the luxury of just focusing on their academics and professional development?

Alex and I are no further ahead from our peers professionally, academically, or developmentally. Our family is frayed, and we are all sad and full of resentment. At some point, you guys will need to accept that this master plan of raising independent children with your unique parenting strategy isn't what you thought it would be, and now you and mom need to put in the work to pick up the scraps and try to make things better. Even if money was not an issue, the rest of these problems would still exist.

Going forward, I expect you and mom to pitch in for my basic living expenses at Zio Luigi and Valerie's. I understand that money is tight so I'm willing to work with you on the specifics.

I also expect mom to read what I have said, or at least eventually. It is unacceptable for her to insist that I do not have the right to challenge her parenting. I know this is hard for her, so I don't expect her to change overnight. But I need her to acknowledge that these things must be discussed, and I need her to agree to work towards being able to speak about these topics with me, on a reasonable timeline (within one year, maybe).  
  
These things are deal breakers to me. I don't see us being able to have a normal relationship until these things are addressed. Respond, or don't. You guys can decide what relationship you want with me going forward, and what you're willing to sacrifice for it. 












I understand you guys are strapped for cash. I also resent the fact that you hold the fact you gave me money for my Europe trip two summers ago over my head (I think it was $2600 in total, but feel free to correct me).  
  
So here's what I propose. There are 24 months in between when you stopped paying for my living expenses (May 2023) and my graduation (May 2025). I also did not pay the $300 in August because I was out of the house. Subtract one month and the money you contributed for my trip to Europe, and we have $7200 - $2600 - $300 = $4300. I expect you to contribute this much money for the basic living expenses I incur during the rest of my studies. I expect the expenses incurred between last June to now (or when/if you decide to pay) up front, and $300 per month until the balance is zero. If you cannot afford to send the accumulated sum all at once, then a payment plan is fine.
