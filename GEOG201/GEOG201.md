Conventions are why maps are eurocentric
- visualization
- abstraction
- production

What is a map?

Scale of maps
- Small scale maps are big, aka show a lot of data


## Lab 1 Reading

Robinson MCM approach:
- Care about how readers and their limitations can understand and read your map
- Cognitive cartography and other science blah blah

Harleian Method
- Exploration of data more emphasized than presentation.
- Maps are not permanent but transient - always changing

Robinson disliked the current field of cartography.

He thought you could make the optimal map with rigorousness using many things
- Standardization
    - e.g. water is blue
- The map should cater to the target audience's ability to understand it
    - Maps should be more or less technical depending on the purpose and readership of the map
    - Maps is a communication from the cartographer to the user of a clear message
- There should be no room for interpretation

The author thinks that no best map can ever exist, because there are biases that lead a cartographer to include or exclude information

Maps don't just seek to describe the world. They seek to communicate particular information - the map communication model.

The making of a map and the ability to choose what is included or not shows 

Harley claims that for the longest time, the power, the communication model, ignores power dynamics. To say that a map is universally the best map for a given activity is wrong because a map exerts power.

Brian Harley claims that maps can be interpreted. Harley claimed that maps can be understood as what is included or not, and then with this we can read what the author is actually trying to say, as if it was a text

In the past, maps were used to show off your territory. Maps were used to show the size of people's plots of ladn to tax them, aka show power


We believe in maps because we can verify a map's data - we can go to the places it shows

Maps can be objective, at least to the very basics of showing if a lake or a road exists. The more abstract ideas are less certain though

We should rethink that cartography is a science
- Water being blue on a map is not science, it is a social construct
- Maps are all based upon social constructs?qays something about whose claim is valid

Author's 3 ideas
1. Think of maps as social construct
2. Document the power in maps



# Lecture 3 - 11/9
Is the first map an etching on stone, or a drawing on paper, or the French map by Cassini

Ancient map - slide 5
Route length measusred in days to travel

The purpose of maps changed over time. Maps in the Middle Ages were often about ideological / biblical ideas (see slide  6). Spatial factuality was less important.

Paradise was in the east, so maps of the world had Asia on top

Ebstorf World Map
- Shows both religious items like Noah's ark and Paradise, but also shows places like Scotland. Not necessarily a navigational tool
- The real world is integrated into the mystical world

T-O: a T inside an O. The world is an O, the T are rivers
- Centered around Jerusalem

Islamic Cartography 
- South oriented

Chinese cartography 
- Had a map in the 12th century

How did we go from TO maps to modern maps?
- New knowledge through the Crusades ... people picked up their knowledge
- Renaissance of the knowledge of the antiquity
- New trade networks in the med. sea
- New mapping techniques
- New perspective on how maps should be used
- 
- Ne ways of visualizign spatial phenomena
- New dsitribution technology e.g. printing

Portolans - 13th century
- Made for nautical use with shipbuilding technology
- Started off as a book describign how to get to ports. They were changed to just a map

From 19th century onwards, portolans no longer used. 

## Renaissance
- Rediscover knowledge of antiquity

### Ptolemy's map
-  described how to make a spherical map (did not actually make it tho)
-  Said to put equator at 0 degrees latitude, Menorca at 0 longitude
-  Understood earth was a globe
-  Oriented his map Northwards due to understanding poles
-  Made 2500 years ago

First globe
- 1492, made by Behaim
- Made it because he wanted to convince a senate to give him money to go to India westwards
- No America

First world map with America
- Waldseemueller, 1507
- Named America after Amerigo Vespucci
- First mass product map, made 1000 copies, everyone wanted it
- Bought by Library of Congress

First atlases
- Mr. Mercator designed a map as carrying the burden of mapping the world, after greek atlas
- Maps world in a way that lets you navigate with compass. Mercator accelerated European navigational supremacy
- Conformal in the way that angles are preserved in the map as in the real world
- Mercator maps allowed you to sail without land in view
- Cartography allows for European dominance

Congo conference
- Berlin 1884-85
- British ,Dutch, French, Germans
- Talked about how to split up Africa

Cassini's map of France
- Made with geodetic calculations ? a modern technology
- First scientific map of France
- Map existed to facilitate social change & capitalism - you can see what land you own. Origin of land registries
- Center of map, and world, is Paris
- Now, Greenwich is the prime meridian

Emergence of mapping conventions
- First mapping convention was for mountains
    - Swiss asked Dufour to come up with way of mapping mountains

State cartography
- To tax citizens, you must see who owns what. 

Thematic maps
- One of the first ones was by Dupin in 1827 - shows proportion of male school attendance
- Booth mapped poverty in London

Aerial images
- First began before WW1
- Developed duuring wars
- Beginning of remote sensing

Landsat
- Started by Soviet Union with their space faring missions
- Right to fly around in space over others' land
- In 1972, Soviets launched first landsat satellite

Birth of GIS
- Invented in 1962 by Canada's dept of Forestry and Rural development
- Canada Land Inventory made by **Roger Tomlinson** REMEMBER ME
- Harvard's Laura and Jack Dangermond invented ESRI


Readings for 13/9
To properly communicate spatial information, you must identify the
- intended audience
- info to communicate
- area of interest
- physical and resource limitations

Maps to be seen from afar are different than maps 


## Map types
Feature maps
- To show points, lines, or other information
- Scale does not have to be represented

Choropleth maps
- Show quantitative information for areas
- Heatmaps / density maps where data is shading or textures on the map
- Regions can be continuous or discrete polygon-defined regions

Dot density maps
- Dots are plotted to represent a specific value described on legends.

Isopleth maps
- Contour maps show lines were there is an equal value along them, such as elevation or temperature

Lecture 9/13
Focus on Data of GIS
Geospatial: geographic + spatial, a subset of spatial that is applied to the earth's surface / near surface

Map Frame - additional data not on actual map
Map on slide 6: Base map + coord system + toponym + weather data  + flight data + anecdotes from pilot + time/day, etc.
Decisions: projections, scale, grid, ocean names, country names, map extract (what map data used), course of map, orientation, coloring, symbologies, legend
Toponym  = place name

What can be mapped? anything and everything


Where should the map be displayed? How much information should be included?

Data: 
paint on a wall can be understood as graffiti. But phenomena =/= data, we classify and abstract phenomena into data


Primary data: GNSS, smart phones, aerial imagery, etc.

Secondary data: scanned maps, maps made by authorities, crowd-sourcing
- less time consuming. Data is already collected and semi processed    

Qualitative vs quantitative data
-nominal level, symbology

Quantitative data
- Displayed by ordinal, interval, or ratio level
- For temperature in C, there is no zero point, e.g. 10c is not twice as cold as 20c.
Ratio level data is the best because you can do many mathematical operations

Field vs object based data
- Raster data is like an image, gets blurry
- Vector data does not blur, stored as vectors

Lab 2 Reading
Maps wear masks. Maps are really just drawings.
Maps are weapons but operate under a veil of scientific authority so we do not think of them as so. We assuem that maps must be accurately representing the world.

Maps inform our world, nto other way around. e.g. if zoning map isn't what is being followed, change what is being done to conform to map. The map is not a representation of the world, but we must make it to be one. 
This zoning map connects citizens to the system of rules and laws of the city.

A zoning map is not built on anything, like a road map is. In the real world, there is nothing defining a particular area as being zoned a certain way.

Maps bring into creation the boundaries and laws it represents

When you need to split land in two, you are drawing a map and deciding where to draw the line. There is not necessarily a physical feature splitting neighborhoods apart - it is arbitrary, defined by the map, not defining the map. Land exists, but not as land of a particular city. 

When you map something as a tree or a road, you attach to it the collective understanding of what a road or a tree is. To describe something takes infinite words, but to label it "a tree", or "a house" reduces all complexity and turns it into what you think a tree or a house is. It is a distillation and abstraction of what is really there. To map something, we have to break it down into easy to understand categories

Maps operate in a system of laws, that's how they do it.

When maps define a certain area as beign a political entity, everyone is connected unwillingly. People of X region are assigned rights and responsibilities, whether or not the real world reflects it.

When the world does not reflect the map, sometimes the world is changed. Infrastructure is built to make what a map designates a lake, a lake.
If a political map of a lake is drawn, that says that property development is allowed within X meters of a lake because it is Y size, then changing its size officially may change property development. Thus, changing the depth of the lake on the map may be unpopular and inconvenient. The lake becomes a political entity because its size is a political issue.

If you ask to map Manhattan, do you include the people that make Manhattan what it is? They are as physical and valid. Why do we just sketch the outline of an island? Does Manhattan reach into northern NY if it sucks water from there?

Land can change - low and high tide, seasons, etc. When we draw the outline of an island, it is the outline of a snapshot in time. It does not represent the entire island over a range of time.

This is the coast paradox - the more precisely you measure a shore, the longer it becomes.
A map marries a corporation to physical land.

Features of a map are not seen as things added to a map but as the map itself. Thus, questioning an item is the same as questioning the map
A thematic map comes across as a map of the world, as opposed to one imposed upon it

Lab 2 Reading - Vinland Map
A fake map made by vikings exploring north america threatened the idea that italians had discovered north america. Bjarni Herjolfsson discovered Vinland as early as 985 AD. Leif Ericson explored it around 1000. Bishop Eirik Gnupsson visited in 1121, and Christopher Columbus came to the Bahamas in 1492. It is thought they left because of hostile natives

Nordic discovery of nroth america didn't lead to a permanent settlement merely because they had not guns but swords and spears

Maps have authority that scholars find difficult to question. It becme a quasi-religious icon.

# Lab 2 Discussion
Maps are the most trusted piece of media. Making a map takes effort. You look at a map and you are conditioned to trust it


PostGres SQL postGIS

# Lecture 20/09
Objects are the smallest unit of a GIS
- e.g. a tree
The object has thematic data
- e.g. a tree's height, species, vitality

Also has geometrical data
- e.g. representation of the object as point - x y z coordinates in coordinate system of location

Also topological data

### all of these are the attributes of an object


Feature classees
- Objects are assigned to feature classes, e.g. all tree objects are assigned to feature class trees

A feature class can only store objects of one geometry type.

think back to paris area path issue

geometry vs topology

geometry: the form of an object. Topology: the position of an object. E.g. two boxes, one rotated 30 degrees, have the same geometry but different topologies

Mesh and Edge table
