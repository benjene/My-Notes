-use mcgill email for grant

Hello Dr. Sengupta / McKenzie / Sieber,

I'm Nicholas, a computer science student here at McGill. I heard from Tim Elrick that you are looking for a CS student to get involved with your research.

It would be great if we could meet to discuss whether I could work with you on a project.


I've attached my CV to this email.

Thank you,
Nicholas Foisy
