How to implement Iterator: 
1. have a field with an array and an index field
2. Have method hasNext()
3. have method next() which returns the next element and advances iterator

How to implement iterable
1. have some array as field
2. Implement iterator() method and have it return a new Iterator<class> object
3.  In an anonymous class, add int index field, hasNext(), next() methods

Iterator vs iterable
You use hasNext and next() directly in main with iterators.
iterable objects, you just use the enhanced for loop directly.
